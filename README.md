# Scheduling Algorithms
This repository has a few python scripts meant for solving math problems related to scheduling algorithms for computer processes with a visual aid for simulating the actual execution of the algorithm. They were designed to work with a temporary xlsx file for editing quickly with a spreadsheets program, with every new run of `main.py` the xlsx is created by deleting any exisisting file with matching filename.

## Requirements
The scripts were intended to work with Microsoft Excel but could work with any spreadsheets program such as LibreOffice Calc. They also require the following python dependencies:
- `numpy` (2.1.0 or higher)
- `pandas` (2.2.2 or higher)
- `matplotlib` (3.9.2 or higher)
- `openpyxl` (3.1.5 or higher)
